  query description: 
  Retrieve the most popular types of creative works that have been modified for a
  period of time (2/3 of one year). This select query retrieves all instances of only
  subclasses of class CreativeWork, the latter is filtered out by using a filter expression.
  Additional constraint is added on their modification time. Results are grouped by
  creative works' type, ordered by their number for each type and a slice of the first 10 
  is selected
  
  example: 
  startDateTime: 2010-08-22T02:56:17Z
  endDateTime: 2011-04-22T02:56:17Z
