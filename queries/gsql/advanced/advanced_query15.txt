  query description: 
  Retrieve a list of N creative works, the ’things’ they are about and mention, their
  categories, the modification date, thumbnail and primary format. Additional
  constraint is added by a filter that selects creative works containing a word which is
  not so commonly used. This is a star-shaped query (similar to query14) that involves
  nine triple patterns (eight joins). The filter expression involves both conjunction and
  disjunction of constraints.

  example:
  word: policy
