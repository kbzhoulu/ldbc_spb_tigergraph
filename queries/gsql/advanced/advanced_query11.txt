  Retrieve similar creative works regarding the ’things’ they are about or mention. This
  query searches for similar creative works, by counting the set of intersecting about
  and mentions values, to which a metric is applied and scores the similarity, e.g.
  similarity score equals (number of identical about tags) * 2 + (number of mentioning
  about tags) * 1 + (number of identical mentions tags) * 0.5
