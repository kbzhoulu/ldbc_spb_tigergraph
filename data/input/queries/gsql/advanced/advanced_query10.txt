  query description: 
  Retrieve a list of N creative works that are mentioning the maximum number of
  topics, their number, creation date and topics. This query uses query9 (as a sub-query)
  to retrieve the greatest number of mentioned topics in creative works and a second
  sub-query which retrieves all creative works that mention as many topics as the
  creative work that has the greatest number of mentioned topics. This match is
  achieved through a filter constraint.
