  query description:
  A drill-down query which retrieves a list of Creative Works that have been modified
  within a defined date-time range. Result is analyzed and another random element is
  selected. Its modification time is further used again to narrow-down the date-time
  range. Query is re-executed, produces a smaller result. Process is repeated several
  times, until no results or iterations limit has been reached.
  
  exmaple:
  startDateTime: 2011-05-01T00:00:00.000
  endDateTime: 2011-05-31T23:59:59.999
